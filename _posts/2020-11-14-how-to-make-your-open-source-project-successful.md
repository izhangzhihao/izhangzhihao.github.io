### What Is Open Source Project

A public available repository does not make a project `Open Source`.

#### Open Source means:

* public available(of course)
* docs about how to use/set up/build/contribute...(Not just README!)
* feature requests/bugs/issues discussion
* pull request reviews
* License & Code of conduct(Can I use that in my personal project? Do I have to make it open source?)
* Formal release!(Is that library/tool *Production Ready*?)

**In short, that's all means "the community".**
